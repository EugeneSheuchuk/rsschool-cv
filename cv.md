###Summary
  I have been interested in computers since school, and in the last 3 years I have become interested in web development.
  At first, my interest in web development was like a hobby - I wanted to learn something new.
  However, over time, I became interested in developing more and more. At some point, I realized that web development
  can become my profession. To do this, I study html, css and javascript and believe that rsschool will help me gain
  and organize the necessary knowledge and skills to get my first job as a web developer.
  
 ###Skills:
 - html/css
 - javascript
 - react
 - redux
 - webpack
 - node.js
 - express.js
